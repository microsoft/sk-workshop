# Sematic Kernel Workshop

Learn how to build LLM Apps with Semantic Kernel through self-contained and independent lessons, in a flexible way so that you can choose the sequence that is most convenient for you.

Typically, each lesson is structured to last approximately one hour, and it is assumed that you already have some Python or coding skills for the hands-on labs.

## Objectives

After completing this workshop, you will be able to:

* Author your own copilot using Semantic Kernel.

* Create AI plugins using semantic and native functions.

* Automate complex tasks execution with planners.

* Create prompt templates to define AI functions.

* Embed Generative AI in your applications.
