    "#### Chat with Your Data Scenario Using Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore how to create a virtual agent utilizing Semantic Kernel, Azure OpenAI models, and AI Search as a Vector Store. This agent will be capable of understanding and responding to user queries in a conversational manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resource Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, you will need to set up the following resources:\n",
    "- An Azure OpenAI service with a deployment of either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo through the Azure Portal. For optimal performance, we recommend using the GPT-4 model.\n",
    "- Within the same Azure OpenAI service, create a deployment for the text-embedding-ada-002 model (version 2) with the name `text-embedding-ada-002`.\n",
    "- Lastly, establish an Azure AI Search service to serve as our memory store.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kernel Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect the Semantic Kernel to these services, configure the environment variables in an **.env** file.\n",
    "Use the provided **.env.template** as a starting point, renaming it to **.env** and updating the variable values accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kernel Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Proceed to initialize the Semantic Kernel and register a persistent **Semantic Memory**. This memory will store and retrieve information as needed by the agent."

The idea is that similar words or data will have similar vectors, and different words or data will have different vectors.
